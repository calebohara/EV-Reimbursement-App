## üìù Version History

### Version 1.10.0

- **Validation & Fallbacks:** Tier inputs validate on the fly; when tiers are enabled and valid, base cost may be blank. If tier inputs are invalid, calculations fall back to the base cost per kWh.
- **Dark Mode Polish:** Improved readability of modal text, placeholders, and disabled inputs (including tiered fields) in dark mode.

### Version 1.9.0

- **Loading Animations**: Introduced Bootstrap spinners for async actions (CSV import, calculations, Excel/PDF exports) with descriptive loading text and disabled states to prevent duplicate actions.
- **Contextual Tooltips**: Added helpful tooltips to date inputs, cost per kWh, CSV upload, chart legends, and primary actions.
- **Automatic Field Generation**: Auto-generates daily kWh fields when both dates are selected and valid.
- **Smooth UI Animations**: Fade-in transitions for the fields box and staggered animations for daily fields.
- **Date Parsing Fix**: Resolved timezone-related offset that caused dates to appear a day early.
- **Dark Mode Contrast**: Fixed text color in Feedback & Support modal and ensured good contrast across new components.
